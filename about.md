I live/work in the Pacific Northwest.  

I started working in tech in my late 20s, went to a code school and spent a lot of time digging into Team Treehouse. I've got a formal education, and it's been about as useful as most life experiences.

Currently, I've been writting a lot of responsive html emails as a contractor for an advertizing agency. It's helped me really appreciate html5 and functional programming.  In my spare time, I like digging into Angular 2, node.js, mongodb, occasionally arduino, and somewhere in there is ionic and nativescript. I'm also somewhere in the process of writing an library for html emails, kinda like Zerb Inc or Twitter Bootstrap, but focused on the templates I've build and refactored in the last few months.
