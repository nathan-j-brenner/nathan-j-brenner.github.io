I'm passionate about creativity and collaboration.

My sense of creativity came from music and education.  It's about recognizing an oppertunity, implementing a method to take advantage of that oppertunity, recognizing the shortcomings of that method as it applies to the oppertunity, which often changes, and making changes to that method.  In music, that's an approach to interpreting the intent of a composer.  In education, the oppertunity is helping someone learn something that you struggled with and can step back from that method and think about what that someone is thinking.

My selse of collaboration also stems from music and education.  In a chamber music ensemble, like a string quartet, each member of the team has an important role in the scope of the team.  A single musician can't have a musical conversation without other musicians.  From the moment a string starts to vibrate, the rest of the team joins in and there's an incredible scene that takes place to the effect that people will watch that dynamic.  There's a struggle in that conversation: When you're working with people, people think differently.  In a collaborative setting, teammates figure out when it's good to stand up for their values and when it's appropriate to comprimise.

In the middle of my master's degree, I realized the connection of these two values, and technology seems to be a much more appropriate area to practice these values. Education also taught me I'm driving by intrisic motivators.Like any artist or engineer (which could be debated that they are the same), I could be prompted by an oppertunity and I'd likely pursue that oppertunity if it involves some creativity and collabortion.
