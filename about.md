My family has been in the Pacific Northwest since 2009.  I grew up in Nevada, so I love the diversity in this area...both the cultures and the weather.  

I started working in tech in my late 20s, went to a code school and spent a lot of time digging into Team Treehouse. I've got a formal education, and it's been about as useful as most life experiences.

2016 was a pretty good year. My work started with responsive html emails as a contractor for an advertizing agency. It's helped me really appreciate html5 and functional programming.  Later I worked as a part of a remote team on some larger Angular applications.

In my spare time, I like brewing beer, working on my house, and spending time with my son, and of course learning more about computer science.
