        <title>Welcome to Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This story, like others to come, started with a treehouse badge.  Actually, it started a few months ago when a guy I was working with was complaining about Jekyll.  Somewhere after that, I built a static-site generator and I saw how easy it was to post blogs…if you’re comfortable typing in a text-editor.  I’ve been coding since November 2014, so I’m more confortable with a text-editor than a word processor.  I’ve tried Atom and Brackets, but I started with Sublime so it never seems worth the learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treehouse came out with a course on Jekyll.  As I was learning about Jekyll, I had a client in mind.  Their site was slow and unresponsive, and it was a wordpress site.  Lots of pages, lots of difficult to read text and small pictures.  A possible solution seemed like a static site generator so that they could have more control over their content without depending on finding the right wordpress plugin.  I’ve got nothing against wordpress, I just came from the school of thought that thinks JavaScript can do everything and more than what php does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is the crud beginnings of my updated portfolio site.  I created a similar site with Foundation back in April, but enough has changed in how I think about programming that I didn’t want to fight that site any more.  It was an oppertunity to learn Foundation, and it was really helpful when I used Foundation on my SnapOR site.  Anyway, this site is live and there’s not much to it but at least it loads faster than the other site and it has my programming projects in the prospective of a historical context.  All that means is the first project is the most recent, and each one before that site shows you a glimpse at how I was thinking a few days or months ago. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
