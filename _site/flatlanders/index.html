  <article class="post-content">
    <p>A few weeks ago, I started exploring Angular.  I started with the Treehouse course, with didn’t make a ton of sense and wasn’t very motivating to work through, but it was something.  Intially I wanted to find how Angular fit into the mvc framework that backbone existed into, and they really don’t fit together at all, and in some cases angular makes more sense to me than backbone has.  So I was struggling thorugh this tutorial the week after my wife gave birth.  Henry James Brenner was born on August 8, and he’s doing great, but dad definatelly needs to start bringing home enough money so mom can spend more time relaxing.</p>

<p>Next stop was the tutorial on codecademy, which I thought was definately one of their better tutorials. A few days ago, I did their php tutorial, and I don’t think it really got beyond the very syntax basics, which is understandable since it’s a server side language.  In any case, the codecademy angular tutorial had a lot of user interaction, and I spent a lot of time searching for my syntax errors and looking at the forum.</p>

<p>Finally, I got to the code school tutorial and I’m pretty sure I’m going to have that song stuck in my head for a while.  At this point, I’ve lost whatever I gained from the treehouse course, and interestingly the code in the codecademy and code school were different and complimentary of eachother.</p>

<p>In the middle of this sequence, I started talking to a few people at networking events and I became relieved as mentioning Angular seemed to have more traction than any of the other tools I had worked with. About a week ago, I had a potential employer send me a project.  I had 24 hours, and since I was working for the army, I had the time I spent from when I got home that evening to when I stopped working that evening.  I could have easily stayed up all night, but I stopped when I had something functional.  The code was messy and I think it was a strong reflection of the sort of work I can produce when left to my devices without anyone to review my code and under a tight deadline.  The code would have looked a lot different if I had worked on it for the next day, and had asked someone to look at it before I sent it off.  </p>

<p>I actually started this project with the intent of writing it with backbone since I had spent more time and worked at greater depth with that framework.  I switched gears when I asked myself what the employer would want to see, along with acknowledging how much time it would take to get refamiliar with backbone after looking at angular for the last couple weeks.  </p>

<p>I read a recent blog post that mentioned their understaning of backbone and angular.  Backbone has a really stiff learning curve, but once you’ve understood everything about it, you can be able to write up some code.  Angular, on the other hand, is very approachable from the beginning but when you want to start creating an app, the documentation becomes less helpful along with the tutorial sites, and basically the programmer needs to look at other angular developers code to find best practices.</p>

<p>From the time I’ve spent with angular, I’m really intrigued, and I’d love to get to know the framework with greater depth.  With JavaScript Harmony out, Angular 2 is around the corners, and I’m seeing the connections that have been made with typescript, angular, and javaScript Harmony.  </p>
