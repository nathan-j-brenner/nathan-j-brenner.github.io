			<p>While I was in JavaScript Immersion during the day, I was teaching the Web Foundations. This repo was an activity I created for the intent that the students would be able to get their hands dirty with git.  In previous versions, the instructor would demonstate this process while the students watched</p>

		<div class="projectDiscription">

		<h2><a href="http://nathan-j-brenner.github.io/portfolioWithFoundation/">Previous Portfolio</a></h2>
		<div class="projectDiscription">
			<img src="/imgs/foundation.png">
			<p>I wrote this right before JavaScript Immersion started and the picture takes forever to load.  It's a single static page with the help of the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> front-end framework.  Over the course of JavaScript, there seemed to be too much that I wanted to change that I decided not to fight this.  I was also writing in a wordPress blog, so this jekyll site fits both of those needs</p>

		<h2><a href="https://portlandcodeschool.github.io/primer//course/">PCS Curriculum</a></h2>
		<div class="projectDiscription">
			<img src="/imgs/pcs.png">
			<p>This was my first published content: lesson plans for each class, with the hope that more web developers could teach this course by following along.  I had no idea what a static site generator was, and I wrote in markdown a lot like I would write in Microsoft Word and add some syntax later.</p>
