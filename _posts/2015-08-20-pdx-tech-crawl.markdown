This was the fourth annual event of this type, and I was really impressed with it.  This event maxed out on it's reservation space, which was a mere 1,129 people, and I'm sure there were more that ended up showing up for the kick-off.

A tech crawl is the tech spin off of a beer crawl.  Instead of walking to a bunch of different microbreweries in one sprint, tech companies on the east side of the Willamette River opened their doors for visitors. As this event has grown in participants each year, there were two possible tracks for people to take: A track specific to companies that are agencies, whereby they create and sell their services and products for other companies, and companies that build and sell their own products.

While I was at Porland Code School for JavaScript Immersion, I had a few field trips of tours of some of the tech companies in the area.  This event went well beyond that experience.  Instead of the focus on just seeing what an office and work space looks like and being able to talk to say one representative of the company, this event was more about connecting with some of the people in these companies and being able to meet other developers from other companies.

Sometimes there are meetups that I go to and I find a huge gap between the amazing developers out there, who are often leeding discussions and presentations, and then students from code schools that have a limited scope on the field.  At this event, I found myself talking to a lot of developers, especially from the front-end.

A challenge with events like this for me is that I haven't found my group to gravitate toward.  I wandered between groups looking for conversations.  I think I ran into two familar faces, and surprisingly no one from Portland Code School.  I have to really let myself go where I want to go and have conversations with people beyond "Hey, you hardly know me, but you should let me play with your code".  Sometimes the conversations start there with the basic question "What do you do?", and I was surprised a few times when the conversation would move to "We're actually looking too", followed by "What have you done?".  

I had several of those conversations last night and I'm looking forward to connecting with some of those people, but there were also several conversations about things outside of tech.  I think for me, it always starts with the art.  What drives you to do something? What are you passionate about?  What drives you crazy?  I love that internal feeling of working on something that drives you crazy (in a good way), and I love talking and working with people that can speak   It's really incredible how many retired teachers and musicians I've met that turned to technology to find what I'm experiencing, which is the ability to be an artist in a different area than where you thought was the only place you could do that.  The job is just a vehicle to exercise those passions.  The language doesn't matter so much as is the core ability to communicate.
