It's labor day weekend, at least I think that's the three day holiday weekend that gives employees an excuss to get a Monday off work, especially if they work for the government (I can never keep track of the names of these holidays.  They should change all their names to "3 day vacation on your tight budget"), and my parents from Vegas are visiting.

I just wrapped up a 3 week stint with the army.  Every year, I have to do two weeks of active duty, and this year I was able to do 3 weeks with another unit in place so I could stay local since my wife was about due to give birth to our first kid.  Without getting too specific, I was really appreciative of the nco's that let me do this, but a lot of it seemed unnecessary.  A lot of it came down to sitting in a room killing time by playing stupid games on my cell phone since I the security on the building was too tight for me to do anything productive.  Bottom line, I was able to do very little coding in the last two weeks, and I got up at 7 am hopeful to work out some bugs that have been driving me crazy in my dreams.

I was able to eat breakfast in silence, but by the time I started looking at documentation, and testing out code, there was too much conversation in the room to be able to do anything more than just write a blog post and play stupid cell phone games.  They're family, and they're visiting, and it's great that they're here...I just have these bugs that are itching the crap out of me and I can't get the space to do anything about it. I'd love to have some time for vacation, but it's like I'm at the last bit of a day long hike and I've got the question to stop and all I really want to do is hike faster.  And now the wife is still sleeping, breakfast is brewing in the house, and it's a half hour from when I'd like to leave to make it to church.  My parents used to indulge, and I got back into it when my wife got pregnunt, so I want to force my way but I'm pretty sure I'll be waiting around all day for other people to tell me what I'm doing today.

The express.js class just came out on treehouse, so I'm eager to work on it as a review.  I spent a bunch of time with express in javascript immersion mostly from trial and error.  Treehouse is great for me because it's so sequential, and I feel like I've got a bunch of potholes on my understanding of the server side code.  There's a bunch of tutorials on node that I want to dig into for the same reason.

I'm also at the point with Angular.js that I can do enough to break things.  Collaboration would be really helpful at this point.  I really like the front end stack of working with angular and bootstrap, and I'd love to work on enough projects to the point where I don't have to dig through the documentation every time I write something.

I've also got a meeting with a potential client this week and I'm really eager to prep for that project.  There's also a tone of little errends I need to take care of, so I'm eager to get started on those and more importantly get started on a project I can make some money on.
