Hey, it's Labor Day Weekend.  My parents from Vegas are visiting, and it's their first time to see their other grandchild.

I just wrapped up a 3 week stint with the army.  Every year, I have to do two weeks of active duty.  My unit travels around the state and gives free concerts.  The due date for our kid was right in the middle of it, and my chain of command gave my the opportunity to stay home and work for another unit in place so I could stay close to home.   This didn't leave much brain space for coding, and this morning I woke up eagerly to work out some bugs.

A lot of my days start out like this.  In most cases, I leave the code broken or messy to rush off to do something else or without knowing how to fix it.  Through the night, my brain dreams up possible solutions.

The express.js class just came out on treehouse, so I'm eager to work on it as a review.  I spent a bunch of time with express servers in javascript immersion.  By the nature of the class, a lot of learning takes place through chaos.  Treehouse is great for me because it's so sequential, and I feel like I've got a bunch of potholes on my understanding of the server side code.  There's a bunch of tutorials on node that I want to dig into for the same reason.

I'm also at the point with Angular.js that I can do enough to break things.  Collaboration would be helpful at this point. I'm noticing a pattern of combining Angular with Bootstrap.  Angular extends html with directives and expressions. A lot of directives look like html attributes, such as ng-app or ng-controller.  With bootstrap, I have to figure out what classes I need to make the DOM look a particular way.
