This is a common interview question. From a look at my resume, the question might even be asked in a way like "You've obviously passionate about the work you did in this other area, so what drives you in programming?"

I love programming because it can be a very abstract way to create some pretty amazing solutions.  For example, say I want to know immediately I get a new email.  When I was in high school, I used to obsessively get on the computer, which involved dialing up the server, log into yahoo, only to be disappointed that there was nothing new.  Now I've got a device that sits in my pocket and I get a push notification for a bunch of different apps, including gmail.  

How does stuff like that work? Did the demand cause the solution or did some computer geek realize the potential of a device that can store data? I love taking things appart, learning how the individual pieces work together, and put the thing back together.  If I can add in some functionality, or clean up how the piece is put together, then even better. I'm not ok with going along with the status quo.  I want to ask why questions like "Why are we doing it this way", or "How can we make this better"?  

As far as work goes, I started a course on MongoDB today, and I started working on a mobile app a few days ago.

MongoDB offers free online courses, which have a weekly series of videos, quizzes, and homework assignments.  I thought this would be a good way to get more in depth knowledge of a non-relational database.

The mobile app is a project another developer included me into.  It uses the ionic framework, which empowers angular web developers to create mobile apps without writing any ios or android native code.  This project is also great because it's forcing me to start looking at and writing in TypeScript with the new es6 syntax, and I'm able to see how Angular is currently being written by a more experienced web developer.
